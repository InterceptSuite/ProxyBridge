# ProxyBridge

Transparent SOCKS5 Traffic Redirector for Windows

ProxyBridge redirects TCP traffic from specific applications through a SOCKS5 proxy transparently using WinDivert packet interception. Works with any protocol (HTTP, HTTPS, databases, RDP, etc.) without application configuration.


## Current Limitations

- UDP Support
- IP v6
- All traffic redirection
- Allow Direct Connection DNS Over TCP

Its still in early stage, may contain bugs, the current focus is on fixing bugs and its still experimental and may contain security issues as its not tested for security bugs.
